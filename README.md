===================================

This is a small, modular application built on RequireJS and AngularJS.

Running
-------

Due to CORS requests it might be best to put the application folder in a HTTP server
like Apache or nginx.

Alternatively you can start a HTTP server with Ruby or python by executing

    ruby -run -e httpd . -p 9090

or

    python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080

in the root directory of this project (where index.html is)!
